            DEAR BESTIE
            <small>You are the best thing happened to me. You are a pure-hearted soul who can create a world of good feelings with your smile.
                 No-one likes to see you cry. Every drop of your tears is precious. So don't shed them over something.
                <p>You means a lot to me. And so does your health and happiness. So here is a wish to say,
                <p><i>"TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH...!"</i></p></p>
